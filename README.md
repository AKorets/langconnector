Editor for connecting words in parallel texts

Language Connector is the editor that allows connecting words in parallel texts.

When you have a text and its translation, very often the difference in the languages is such that it is not obvious 
which word is the translation of which.
The editor allows the translator to connect manually every word or expression from the text in one language 
to its counterpart in the text in the other language.

In the resultant text the connections allow the reader, 
whithout a deep knowledge or even without any knowledge of the original language, 
read the translation as if he is reading the original text.
